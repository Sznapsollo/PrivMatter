# PrivMatter

Tool for managing files with notes/scripts/passwords and other data. Can follow files from different folders using small local server.

Also has capabilities to encrypt decrypt files containg security data like passwords, private data etc.
Password is used for encryption/decryption. It is not saved or send anywhere to the cloud. You forget it then you have a problem ;-)

Something like bitwarden but smaller, easier to use and completely local - no sending data anywhere outside your system.
