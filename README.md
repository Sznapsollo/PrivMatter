# PrivMatter

Tool for managing files with notes/scripts/passwords and other data. Can follow files from different folders using small local server.

Also has capabilities to encrypt / decrypt files containg security data like passwords, private data etc.
Password is used for local encryption/decryption of files that you choose to encrypt. 
It is not saved or send anywhere. You forget it then you have a problem ;-)
Chosen files can be of course encrypted with different passwords.

Something like bitwarden but smaller, easier to use and completely local - no sending data anywhere outside your system.
